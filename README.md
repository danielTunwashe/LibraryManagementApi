# LibraryManagementApi
The Library Management API allows library administrators to manage books, authors, genres, and users. Each user has a profile, books are written by authors, and books can belong to multiple genres. This project captures real-world relationships like one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many in a clean API design.
